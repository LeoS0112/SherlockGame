# Project Title

**Description:** 

We have built a Sherlock inspired puzzle game, which is unique in the fact you will have a different experience every time. Using GPT 3.5 and GPT-4 to revolutionize game development by integrating Prolog, a logic programming language, ensuring structure in the simulated world. We used Stability to generate characters based off the name and description of the character. We used prompt engineering to dynamically produce character images, based off the userâ€™s interactions with them. We also made background carpets and the main character avatar. s as referred to in Google's Research into Alpha Geomrtry. We used prolog to prevent hallucinations because Prolog is logical programming language which can provide structure to LLM live user image integration personalizes the experience. With lightweight design and revolutionary concept, we will have a high market impact. We believe we will have a significant industry game-changer with a focus on generative games.


## Setup
This will be all ran on bother **Swift** and **Python**
To set up the backend you will need to run the requremnets.txt in the backend folder directory:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install openai pyswip
  
```

You will need to also install:

```bash
scoop install acorn
```

## Running Project

To run the project you will need to run the the game_items.py file and in another terminal run: 

```bash
acorn login
```
Create an account then run:

```bash
acorn dev .
```

you will recieve a link when it start and copy this link into the file image_uploader.py in the backend folder: 

```
endpoint = "your link that was generated"
```

## Tech Stack
